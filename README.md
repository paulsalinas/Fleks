# Fleks
Fleks is a workout builder app for iOS. From a database of canned exercise plus exercises you can create yourself, you can create custom workouts with different rep/sets schemes and variations that you can refer to when you're at the gym. This was build for my Udacity iOS NanoDegree

2. FBSDK for login and authentication
3. Cocoapods for package management
4. XCode 7.3.1

6. ReactiveCocoa for some FRP goodness (still a noob and learning)
7. MVVM to avoid Fat Controllers 
8. Quick and Nimbe for some unit tests
